# Hangouts Notifications for Bamboo

Let Bamboo send your build results to your Google Hangouts Chat.

Just add a webhook to the Google Hangouts room where you want to see built result messages. Copy the URL, add a new notification to your build plan in Bamboo, choose "Hangouts" as notification type and add the webhook URL there. 
It's as easy as that.
